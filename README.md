Completed On: 27 March 2016  
Last Updated: 01 December 2016

## Objectives

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV.

**Rule #1**: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

**Rule #2**: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

## User Stories

- I can see the weather in my current location.
- I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
- I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
